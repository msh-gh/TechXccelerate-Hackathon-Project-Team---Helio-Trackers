# TechXccelerate-Hackathon-Project-Team---Helio-Trackers
This repo contains the detailed information about our project work done during TechXccelerate Hackathon as a Team - Helio Trackers

We, Team Helio Trackers, are beyond excited to share that we secured the 1st Prize at the 24-hour National Hackathon – TechXcelerate under the IoT domain, winning a cash prize of ₹25,000! 

Problem Statement:
---------------------
Traditional solar panels stay static or use inefficient tracking methods, causing energy loss  and reduced performance. Lack of real-time monitoring also delays fault detection and limits optimization. 

Our Solution:
-----------------
We developed an IoT-based Solar Tracking System that includes:
Dual-Axis Tracking – LDR sensors + servo motors auto-adjust panel angles based on sunlight 
Real-Time Monitoring – A web dashboard displaying temperature, humidity, power output, and efficiency metrics

Impact:
----------
Maximizes solar absorption
Reduces manual intervention
Enhances energy efficiency
Promotes sustainable power generation
